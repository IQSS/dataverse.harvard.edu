Globus at Harvard Dataverse
===========================

This is an attempt to quickly put together some documentation/end-user instructions on how to use Globus for transfers to and from Globus-based store(s) here at HDV.

The 2 guides, for [downloads](download.md) and [uploads](upload.md) are very Harvard-specific (hence this repo), but some of it may still be of interest to other Dataverse instances considering integrating Globus.

Please keep in mind the experimental nature, both of these documents (which are still in review as of writing this) and the Globus support in Dataverse overall.
