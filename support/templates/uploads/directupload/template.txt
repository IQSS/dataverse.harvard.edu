The message below was sent in response to an RT request where a remote
user was specifically asking about being able to use SFTP to upload
files to Dataverse. This part can be skipped and the message should be
further modified as needed. (once again, this is just a template).

=====

We don't support SFTP, sorry. We do support something called "direct
upload" - in that mode the files are not uploaded to/streamed through
the Dataverse application. Instead your browser interacts with
Dataverse only to get an upload authorization, and then uploads the
file directly to the S3 storage volume on the cloud. This generally
works more reliably for larger files.

The drawback of this method is, because Dataverse is not involved and
doesn't receive the file, there is no automatic unzipping - the files
need to be uploaded separately, and your local folder structure is NOT
going to be preserved. There is however a command line client
available - DVUploader, developed by a 3rd party, that can upload all
the files from a folder/folders, recursively, while preserving the
folder names. If you are comfortable using command line tools, I can
send you more info and instructions.
